# Overview
This is a simple django project. I used django to create the user and post admin. People can log in as a user and make post. 


This is a simple blog. People can post their recipe on the blog and use the converter to convert the celsiuse to fahrenheit and US fluid ounce to milliliter.

This web app is for posting the recipes. People can use it to store and share their favorite recipes here. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

I use javascript and HTML to create the pages. I also use javascript to create the link of the page, so user can click on the link and go to different pages. The home page is for the blog (recipes), the converter page is for conver the celsiuse to fahrenheit and US fluid ounce to milliliter.

# Development Environment

I am using django, python, javascript, and HTML.

I used the html and javascript the most.
