# Overview

This is a guessing number game.

The system will pick the random number and the player can enter to guess the number. I used if statement to tell user if they need to enter a bigger number or smaller number. Then use while loop to help user can enter the number multiple times. 

The purpose for writing the software is to learn how to use kolin with variable, expression, conditional, loop, and function.
